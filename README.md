================

Ok so this is a test of editing mostly. I'm not sure where this is going to show up. For now I'm trying to learn a bit more about version control.

Projects I want to put on Git

1. My personal website
: Until I get some time to pay for my domain (SecretAwesomeDomain here) and get my hosting account back. (Because yes i am that broke i can't afford my domain much less cheap gator hosting. 

2. YS4G Resources
: I'm working on a number of solutions for maintaining the YS4G documents for the elective counsel. Right now I like a sort of version control. However as difficult as it is to get every one to use google drive I'll probably run into PEBKAC problems

3. Province Module
: I made a Vassal Module for Province. unfortunately itw as one computer ago so I haven't worked on it in a while. So I'd like to get back to it and try to publish it somehow. esp now that they're pushing a new deluxe version and it's been a while for the iOS app to get traction 

4. Design elements
: I design a lot of things like posters and such. Maybe GitHub is a good place to place my WIP while DeviantArt is a good place for my finished products
